# Sudoku48H

## Overview
**Sudoku48H** is a project developed as part of a 48-hour challenge to test the developer's skills. The objective was to create a functional Sudoku game in Unity without referencing online resources. The project was completed in under 14 hours, with a significant portion of time spent refining the UI rather than the core game logic.

This repository showcases the developer's ability to quickly create a functional and engaging game under strict constraints. The target audience includes Sudoku enthusiasts and individuals interested in evaluating the developer's skills.

## Features
- Play the classic **Sudoku (9x9)** game.
- Switch between **Roku Doku (6x6)** and **Shi Doku (4x4)** modes.
- Flexible codebase designed to accommodate grids of any size (e.g., a hypothetical 100x100 grid would function seamlessly).
- Accessible gameplay hosted online for instant play.
